  "docs-image-layout-resolution-description": "The **resolution** prop represents the number of horizontal pixels in the drawing area. If changed, existing content will be scaled and new strokes will adopt the new definition.",
  "docs-image-layout-dimensions": "Dimensions",
  "docs-image-layout-dimensions-description": "The drawing view dimensions are defined by the **width** prop, which accepts any valid React Native style value. To modify the dimensions, only **width** needs to be specified, as the aspect ratio will determine the height.",
  "docs-image-layout-aspect-ratio": "Aspect Ratio",
  "docs-image-layout-aspect-ratio-description": "The aspect ratio is set by the optional **aspectRatio** prop. Its default value is 1 (square). The recommended way to define the aspect ratio is using a `width / height` fraction. Changing the aspect ratio may crop the lower content or expand the drawing area to fit the new value.",
  "docs-image-layout-warning": "It is not recommended to modify these props (resolution, width, aspectRatio) during drawing, as they are designed to remain fixed. Changes may cause visual inconsistencies.",
  "docs-image-layout-image-quality": "Image Quality",
  "docs-image-layout-image-quality-description": "Drawing at a low resolution may show antialiasing effects. To disable this smoothing (showing natural pixelation instead), set the **antialiasing** prop to `false`."

  "docs-history-gc-info": "The history implements a garbage collector to automatically remove unnecessary snapshots and save memory space.",
  "docs-history-navigation-subtitle": "History Navigation",
  "docs-history-undo-redo": "To navigate the history, use the `Draw.undo` and `Draw.redo` methods to undo and redo changes respectively. When modifying an old snapshot, redo opportunities are lost, resetting the history from this new point.",
  "docs-history-warning-exceptions": "Attempting to undo/redo when at history limits will throw an exception.",
  "docs-history-warning-resolution": "If the drawing resolution changes, the history will reset, using a rescaled version of the current image as the first snapshot.",
  "docs-history-event-subtitle": "HistoryEvent",
  "docs-history-event-props": "Every history change triggers a `HistoryEvent`, handled by the **onHistoryMove** prop. Its properties include **target**, **canUndo**, and **canRedo** (booleans indicating safe undo/redo availability at the current history point).",

  "docs-getting-started-required-props-description": "The drawing canvas requires some props to work properly: **resolution**, **color** and **tool**.",
  "docs-getting-started-resolution-heading": "Resolution",
  "docs-getting-started-resolution-description": "Represents the number of horizontal pixels[Default aspect ratio will be 1:1 (square)] that the image will contain. Increasing this value improves image quality and resource requirements.",

  "docs-getting-started-load-event-description": "Another important concept is the **Load** event, which will be triggered when the drawing canvas is ready to render images, and therefore, drawing can begin.\nThe **onLoad** callback receives a `LoadEvent` object, whose `target` property is the reference to the drawing canvas that generated the event.",

  "docs-image-layout-aspect-ratio-description": "The aspect ratio is set by the optional **aspectRatio** prop. Its default value is 1 (square). The recommended way to define the aspect ratio is using a `width / height` fraction. Changing the aspect ratio may crop the lower content or expand the drawing area to fit the new value.",

  "docs-grid-description": "You can set up a grid using the **grid** prop. It can receive a single value, which will represent the number of cells to divide the visible space both horizontally and vertically, or it can receive a tuple `[ number, number ]`, where the first number represents the number of horizontal cells and the second the number of vertical cells.",
